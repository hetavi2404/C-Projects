Hotel Management System in C
This is a console-based hotel booking system developed in C. It allows basic management of hotel rooms and customer interactions such as booking, check-in, check-out, and cancellations. Itâ€™s designed as a beginner-level project to demonstrate logic building and use of arrays, conditionals, and basic I/O operations.
